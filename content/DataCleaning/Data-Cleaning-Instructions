This is a folder that stores the data cleaning procedures, including the three raw .dta files for your discretion if you want to run it your self. 

Notice that if a file's name is starting with "Do", like "DoDirector", it means that's the .do file for the corresponding .dta file. 
e.g. "DoDirector.do" is supposed to process the data named "DirectorData.dta"

"Cleaning_Process.log" is a file that recorded what I've done with STATA and it navigates you on how I got the final dataset.
I recommend you to check for "Cleaning_Process.log" file becuase otherwise you will need a lot of time to understand what I've done with the data,
eventhough I succinctly wrote about the process in my paper (the .pdf file in the main repository)

All you need to have for the entire data cleaning process is three .dta files named "CEOCompensation.dta", "CompanyFinancials.dta", "DirectorData.dta",
and the .do files. After processing the corresponding .dta file, I named them as "RefinedXXXXX.dta". 
For the "RefinedXXXXX.dta", there are corresponding "DoRefinedXXXXX.do" that requires you to run it again on the refined .dta files.
After running all these .do files, you would get the final dataset.
